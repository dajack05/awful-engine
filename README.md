# Awful Engine

## What is this mess?
Just something I'm playing with... It's not really meant for the light of day lol

## Why C99?
Because screw you! I do what I want!

In reality, it's just a fun challenge. I'm pretty used to C++11 and greater, so going back to C99 has been fun.

## I fOuNd A bUg!
I don't care... Go fix it and then leave me a PR I guess.
